# üõ†Ô∏è Lumenze SDLC AI Agent ‚Äî Local Development Guide

Welcome to the local development setup for the SDLC AI Agent Orchestrator. This backend service converts feature requirements into structured Jira tickets using LLMs like GPT-4o.

---

## üìì Prerequisites

> These are needed **on the host machine**. Docker will handle the rest.

### Required Tools:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

  * Make sure Docker is installed, running, and you have access to Docker CLI

> **No need to install Python, Redis, or FastAPI** on your host machine.

---

## üöÄ Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/sdlc-ai-agent-orchestrator.git
cd sdlc-ai-agent-orchestrator
```

---

## üîê Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.dev` file in the root of the project (same directory as `docker-compose.local.yml`):

### Example `.env.dev`

```dotenv
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx-your-api-key
WEB_PORT=8000
REDIS_PORT=6379
```

If you have additional variables (e.g., Slack webhook, Claude key, etc.), include them here.

---

## üîÑ Step 3: Run Locally with Docker

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up --build
```

This will:

* Build the image
* Start FastAPI server at `http://localhost:8000`
* Start Redis cache

### Access the Swagger UI

[http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

---

## üì≤ Step 4: API Usage

Use Swagger UI or `curl` to test file upload:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/generate-tickets \
  -F "requirements_file=@requirements/samples/login_dashboard.md" \
  --output generated_tickets.csv
```

---

## üìä Step 5: Logs & Caching

* Logs: Displayed in terminal with timestamps
* Caching: Stored in `.cache/` folder locally to reduce LLM token usage

  * Clear with: `rm -rf .cache/`

---

## ‚ùå Step 6: Stop or Cleanup

Stop services (without removing volumes):

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml down
```

Stop and remove everything including volumes:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml down -v
```

Optional global cleanup:

```bash
docker system prune -f
```

## ü§ù Common Errors & Fixes

| Error                        | Likely Cause                     | Fix                                            |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY must be set` | Missing or unreadable `.env.dev` | Ensure the file exists and is correctly named  |
| `Cannot connect to Redis`    | Redis container failed to start  | Check Docker logs and port conflicts           |
| 404 on `/generate-tickets`   | Wrong route or server not up     | Verify FastAPI server is running and reachable |

---

## üîß Debugging Tips

* Confirm containers:

  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```
* Inspect logs:

  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml logs -f
  ```
* Bash into running container:

  ```bash
  docker exec -it <container_name> /bin/bash
  ```
